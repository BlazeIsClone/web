3. **Custom Website**: ideal if you’re looking for a unique design that reflects your brand personality and offers specific features or functionality. (an investment)
4. **E-Commerce Site**: best for businesses that want to sell products online with a secure, user-friendly store and smooth checkout experience. (an investment)
5. **Portfolio or Showcase Site**: perfect for creatives, freelancers, or agencies who want to highlight their work in a unique, visual way to express their personality. (mid-range to somewhat expensive)

## Domain Name & Hosting

## Maintenance
