---

Straightforward command line interface for downloading backup snapshots of MySQL Databases and Application File Systems written in Rust Programming Language.

Backup CLI is an interactive CLI tool for capturing database snapshots and application files, then securely transfers them to your local storage via SFTP. Perfect for developers looking for a lightweight, no-nonsense backup strategy.

- **Zero Guesswork**: The interactive prompts mean you don't have to remember complex flags or syntax.
- **FS/DB**: Handles both the data (MySQL) and the filesystem (Files).
- **Secure**: Uses SFTP to ensure data is encrypted while in transit to your backup server.
