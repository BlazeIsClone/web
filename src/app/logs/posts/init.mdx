I tried making websites in the past, had many visions of what I wanted it to look like...
Tried building websites before with all these fancy ideas... but a decade later, I finally thought to my self, “You know what, I'm just gonna make something that works.”

### The New Beginning

So here we are, took a NextJS starter template and 3 hours later, here we are live. It's crazy how easy all of this has become, but wait, aren't we supposed to feel overwhelmed with all the things we have to pick up and learn? I mean, NextJS uses React under the hood, and it written in JavaScript, specifically ES6, and to get this running, we need to have NodeJS runtime installed. And that's just running the thing... making layouts and getting the functionality to work is another story.
