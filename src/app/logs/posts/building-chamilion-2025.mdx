It began with a simple [HTML invoice template](https://blazeisclone.github.io/invoice-template/) just enough JavaScript sprinkled in to let you generate your own invoice.
But soon we wanted more and that was a place to keep everything organized and stay accountable. Chamilion was set out to be built around this straightforward idea.

### 12 months of progress

The first version was bootstrapped in no time, and we onboarded our first client right away. Built on Laravel with no fancy libraries or frontend frameworks, just a sturdy backend we could rely on.
It’s been a year since that initial release. Since then, we’ve gone through a few lifecycle shifts, and today you can create quotations, manage recurring invoices, and preview revenue analytics.

### Shaping the brand

We focused on the product first, and now it feels like the right time to think about how we want the brand to show up. Our first steps were a landing page and it's here! [https://chamilion.com](https://chamilion.com)

### The technical and the not-so-technical bits

Soon we figured out building the product was only one part of the iceberg. Fixing bugs and shipping updates wasn’t enough Every fix came with a quick heads-up,
and every new feature meant taking the time to show our users how it could make their workflow just a bit better.

### What’s Ahead

Moving forward, we can expect a full UI overhaul. We already have features that really boost what our users can do, now we just want Chamilion to reflect our core value and to keeping everything dead simple as possible.
